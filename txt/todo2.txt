Testing probability tree against new data:

- (/) write code which does sample matching against new data, so you have at the
  end new sequence which can run against old tree
- then measure
-- how many sequences were achieved partially or completely
-- how many sequences were not touched at all

Test data scenarios:
- sample counts 10000 variation 0.005
1, 2, 3 units of data
- big intervals with rescale period 5, 3 minutes with 10, 15, 20 sample
  lengths
- small intervals with rescale period 30, 60 minutes with 10, 15, 20 sample
  lengths

- what would be profit if those were fully used (partial and complete together
  avoid using first marking sample in calculation)
- experiment with sequence length and samples size to get idea about different
  gain prospects

- do not invest when it is known unknown so you can implement fuzzy logic, hmm
  this is problematic as we get what we get so probably not possible to
  implement
-- make sure that you record correct start_and_end position for trade so you
   can compute properly gain
-- also make sure that probability is computed correctly
-- and where we are in the trade data
- shall I allow to not have any known unknown if there is not one available ?
