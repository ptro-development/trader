*Focus*

    The focus in name of diagram file name represents roughly how "imprecise"
    distances between A and B can be. Smaller focus number means higher
    precision and less loose representation of relations. The time is not in
    seconds but rather in compressed units, so

    e.g. focus number 50 means that time compressing unit is 50 and
         A and B positions gravitated / were adjusted to the closest
         unit index.

*Node*

    e.g.: +1426795010

    It represents #FactCorrelation in diagram as a +number /-number.
    #FactCorrelation represent correlation between two different samples.
    The number is epoch time position of sample which was used for as etalon
    to find other correlations. Samples were preselected based on their
    appearance count. Plus sign means positive correlation and minus sign
    means negative correlation

*Line between nodes*

    e.g.: +1426795010_-1426796000_2_50

    Line has string in format A_B_X_Y
        A represents the first #FactCorrelation
        B represents the second #FactCorrelation
        X represents appearance number of Left-Right type relation between A and B
        Y represents distance between A and B in compressed time periods
          units. The time is not in seconds but rather in compressed units, so
          e.g.: 50 means 50 * compression_time_period
