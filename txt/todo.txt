Build probability tree:

- tree can have different depth
- leaf can have multiple other leafs
- each leaf has computed probability

a -> a (0.2) (price_delta_average, trade_delta_average ?)
  -> b (0.3)
  -> c (0.4)
  -> no match (0.1) -> a
                    -> b
                    -> c
                    -> no match

Questions for leaf:

- what is probability of success and failure ?
- what is probability of another leaf ?

Strategy for using tree:

- based on likelyhood of (success & price_delta & trade_delta_average)
choose how much to invest
- when to sell is another question ?
