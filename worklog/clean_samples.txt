With window 60 seconds and sample size 15 which makes 15 minutes log samples in 3 months and 20000 samples we have too many correlations which makes it hard when doing computation. To much data to loop through.

Setup above led to 13 million correlation facts for example. To keep the amount of samples lower following things should be tried to keep only most fitting samples.

- higher correlation factor should be required 0.985, 0.99, 0.995
- write code to remove overlapping matches from samples which have the most matches to keep only those which are with sample with higher correlation
- min variation should be removed to get rid of empty gaps because a lot of sample are going to be small
